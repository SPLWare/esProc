	<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Grouping is a common traversal type
operation, which needs to read and calculate all records participating in
grouping. For this type of operation that needs the participation of the whole
set, the index makes little sense (useful only in very few scenarios, we will
discuss in the next chapter). Since some programmers do not understand the
principle of grouping, they will add indexes to the database tables in case of
slow grouping, doing so will only increase the load of database.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Grouping process is typically divided into
the following steps: firstly, generate an empty grouped result set; secondly,
traverse each original data; thirdly, calculate the grouping key value of each
original data; and lastly, search the grouped subset corresponding to the key value
in grouped result set, and add this record to grouped subset. If the grouped
subset cannot be found, add a new grouped subset composed of this record.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>During this operation process, the
occurrence times of some actions like reading the records from original data,
calculating the grouping key values of records, and adding the records to
grouped subset, are definite (equal to the record number of original data).
Since there is no way to reduce the occurrence times, the only method to reduce
operations is to find the grouped subset in the grouped result set. This method
is a standard search operation, which generally adopts the hash method in case
no special conditions are available. The hash method works in a way that the
grouped subsets are arranged according to the hash value of their corresponding
grouping key values (equivalent to sequence number positioning), and the grouping
key values and hash values are calculated when there is a new record, which can
quickly find its own group in a small number of grouped subsets with same hash
value. This grouping algorithm is also called <b>hash grouping</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The sum of grouped subsets is as large as
original data set. If the memory cannot store the data due to too-large data amount,
then, nor the grouped subset does, therefore, this method only applies to in-memory
data sets. However, in most cases, grouping always comes with aggregation, we
do not need to keep grouped subsets, but only need to calculate the aggregation
value of grouped subsets, and these aggregation values can often be achieved by
cumulative methods such as summing, counting, computing maximum / minimum
value. In this way, the grouped subset can be discarded, and just keeping the
grouping key value and corresponding aggregated value will work (it is equivalent
to a table sequence rather than a set of sets), as a result, the result set
will be much smaller, and it is also possible to get a small grouped result set
that can be stored in memory even if the amount of original data is large. In this
process, it still needs to find the target record to do accumulation, and it
also needs to use hash scheme, this kind of grouping and aggregating is still
called hash grouping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sometimes, even if only the aggregation
value is needed, the grouped result sets may still be too large to be stored in
memory, that means the number of grouping key values is very large. This
situation is called <b>big grouping</b>, while another situation where the
result set is small enough to be stored in memory, is called <b>small grouping</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When dealing with big grouping, it is necessary
to extend hash grouping algorithm to external storage. To do this, we need to
expand the range of hash values first to let the grouping key values be
dispersedly under different hash values to the utmost extend, resulting in a
situation that not many grouping key values correspond to the same hash value.
Since the range of hash function is known in advance, divide this range into
several intervals that can be stored in memory (simple equal division is OK).
In the process of data traversing, every time a batch of records is read,
calculate the hash value of its grouping key value, and write to different buffer
files based on the interval in which it is located, and then release the memory
space to read the next batch of records until the end of traversal. After that,
read the data from each buffer file separately, and do hash grouping again.
Since the hash values of data in each buffer file fall within one of intervals,
and they can definitely be stored in memory, separate data read and hash
grouping can be performed without causing out of memory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>SPL designs two functions for the
aggregation of big grouping and small grouping respectively. Small grouping
will directly return the result set, while big group will return a cursor. This
cursor is based on the above-mentioned buffer file, and the second round of
grouping and aggregating will be performed during data fetching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Both functions have same parameter rules.
The groups() function of small grouping will directly use hash algorithm, while
the groupx() function of big grouping will use hash algorithm only after adding
@u option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Small grouping does not need to generate buffer
files, while big grouping certainly does. When the function of big grouping is
used to achieve small grouping, a lot of time will be wasted for writing buffer
file, even if the final grouping result is small. It is very important to
predict the size of the grouped result set in advance and select an appropriate
function. Therefore, SPL provides two grouping functions, you can compare the
calculation time of A2 and A3 respectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We also find that the order of grouped result
sets returned by groupx() is disordered, it seems that it has nothing to do
with the grouping key value as well as the order of original data set. In fact,
this is exactly the characteristic of hash grouping, and the reason why it
looks disordered is that the result set of hash grouping is sorted according to
the hash value of grouping key value. On the contrary, SPL will perform a sort
according to grouping key value before the groups() function of small grouping
is returned, therefore, it looks that the key values are ordered. If you use groups@u,
same result will occur.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There is another method to achieve big
grouping, and this method can achieve big sorting as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This method works in a way that traverse each
record in turn, and perform the hash grouping method described at the beginning
of this section (hash range cannot be too large), but what is different is that
this method needs to constantly monitor the number of effective grouping key
values in the grouped result set in the memory. Once the number reaches a threshold,
the following steps should be performed, first, sort the current grouped result
set according to grouping key value; second, write it to a buffer file; and
then clear and release the memory space occupied by the grouped result set; and
lastly, continue to traverse the remaining records. Repeat these steps until
the traversal is completed, and you will finally obtain a batch of buffer
files. Since the data in these files are arranged in an orderly manner according
to grouping key value, you only need to perform two operations, namely, ordered
merge algorithm as well as ordered grouping and aggregating. Both these two
operations can be achieved with only a small amount of memory. This kind of grouping
algorithm is called <b>sort grouping</b>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, the result from this kind of big
grouping is also a cursor based on buffer files, and the second round of
merging as well as grouping and aggregating are performed in the process of
cursor data-fetching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The groupx() without options works
according to this algorithm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Compared with hash grouping, sort grouping
has some advantages. The grouped result set of sort grouping is directly
ordered according to grouping key values, which may be used in the next round
of calculation, more conveniently, big grouping algorithms (and functions) can
be used to achieve small grouping. After carefully studying the above algorithm
process, you will find that if the actual result set is small, it will not
really trigger the action of writing buffer files, because the grouped result
set in memory will never be large enough to the threshold at which the buffer
files should be written.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Another advantage of sort grouping is that
it is more stable. Since there are some cases where you are unlucky with the
hash function, these cases just lead to a waste of time for in-memory search,
while for big grouping, it may happen that there are too many grouping key
values under a hash value, and cannot be stored in the memory, in this case, a
second round of hashing is needed, which is very troublesome and low in
performance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Therefore, the big grouping provided by SPL
by default is sort grouping (no options).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, when you are sure that it is a large
grouped result set (buffer files will definitely be written), and you are lucky
with the hash function, then the hash grouping is more efficient than sort
grouping. The reason is that the sort itself is relatively slow, and multiple buffer
files need to be read at the same time when merging in second round, resulting
in the concurrent read of more hard disks. The second round of hash grouping,
however, only needs to read one buffer file at a time, which will not cause
concurrent read of hard disk. Therefore, SPL also provides the method of
hashing big grouping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Database usually uses an optimized hash
grouping method. This method will first try a small range of hash functions. If
too many grouping key values are found, it will do the second hashing and
perform buffering. In this way, the phenomenon that buffer data is always
written can be avoided. This method has better performance in case of small
grouping, but its algorithm process is much more troublesome, and its
performance will decline seriously in case of big grouping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>However, even if the sort grouping can be
adaptively to both small grouping and big grouping, groupx() is still more
complex and a little worse in performance in comparison with groups() in practice.
More importantly, the parallel effect of big grouping is not good.
Specifically, multiple threads will accumulate to the same intermediate result
set at the same time, and will often deal with the waiting state because of the
preemption of write rights. On the other hand, if each thread has its own
intermediate result set, it will result in the split of memory (each thread can
only use a fraction of memory), furthermore, when there may be no need to write
buffer files (the whole memory is enough to store grouped result set), the
phenomenon of writing buffer files will also occur (as a fraction of memory is
not enough), in this case, the hard disk will read and write very slowly, and
it's easy to offset the benefits of CPU’s parallel operation. Even if in the
case that buffer files are definitely needed, and multiple threads write buffer
files at the same time, it will cause concurrent write to the hard disk, and
often seriously affects the performance. Therefore, groupx() function does not
necessarily achieve better performance for multi-cursor operation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>As a result, if you clearly know that the
result set is small, you still need to use groups() to get the best
performance. In case you can predict the size of result set, you can also
choose an appropriate number of parallels. When the size of result set is not
clear, using groupx() will be more secure, and the performance loss in case of
single thread is not large.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Following the understanding sort grouping,
big data sorting will also be relatively simple, which can be described as the
following simple steps: order the data after a batch of data is read, and then
write them to buffer files, and finally perform the merge algorithm to sort
these buffer files. The size of the result set of sort operation is same as
that of original data set, and it will not become smaller like grouping, so big
sorting will definitely generate buffer files.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, it is not easy to obtain a
linear performance improvement for parallel computing of big sorting. Although
sorting in the memory can be faster, the concurrent writing of multiple threads
to hard disk may offset the advantage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>SPL does not directly provide a hash
grouping style big sorting algorithm; you can work out the algorithm yourself after
understanding the program cursor technology as well as serial number segmentation
mechanism in the next chapter. Usually, big sorting is only used in the data
preparation stage, and the merge algorithm can be performed in most cases, and
there are not many cases where sorting is performed to original big data.</span></p>
