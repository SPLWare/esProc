<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='mso-bidi-font-size:
10.5pt;color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN'>By simply creating an index on the dimension
will have some effect, but just a little. </span></span><span class=jlqj4b><span
lang=EN style='color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN'>Although using the index can
quickly locate the records that meet the condition, if the physical storage
location of these data is not continuous, there will still be a lot of waste while
reading. When the target data are too scattered, using index may not be much
better than full traversal. The reason is that in multidimensional analysis
operation, even if slicing is performed, the amount of data to be read is still
very large. The main application scenario of index is often to select a small
amount of data.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='color:black;
mso-ansi-language:EN'>If the data are stored orderly by a certain dimension, the
slicing condition of this dimension can be used to limit the target data to a
continuous storage area, in this way, there is no need to traverse all the
data, and the amount of reading can be effectively reduced. However, each
dimension may have a slicing condition in theory, if the data are sorted by
each dimension, it is equivalent to being copied several times, as a result,
the cost of such storage is somewhat high.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='color:black;
mso-ansi-language:EN'>A compromise is to store two copies of data sets, that
is, one copy is sorted by dimensions D1,...,Dn and stored, and the other copy
is sorted by Dn,...,D1 and stored. In this way, although the amount of data
will be doubled, it is still acceptable.</span></span><span class=jlqj4b><span
lang=EN style='mso-ansi-language:EN'> <span style='color:black'>For any
dimension D, there will always be a data set that makes D in the first half of
its sorted dimension list. If it is not the first dimension, the data after
slicing will generally not be concatenated into a single area, but the data are
also composed of some relatively large</span> <span style='color:black'>continuous
areas. The closer to the top the position of dimension in the sorted dimension
list, the higher the degree of physical order of data after slicing will be.</span></span></span><span
class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN-US style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.5pt;background:white;
mso-font-kerning:0pt'></span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='color:black;
mso-ansi-language:EN'>While calculating, it is enough to use one dimension's
slicing condition to filter, and the conditions of other dimensions are still used
for traversal calculation. In multidimensional analysis, the slice on a certain
dimension can often reduce the amount of data involved by several times or tens
of times. It will be of little significance to reuse the slicing condition on
other dimensions, and it is also very difficult to implement. When multiple
dimensions have slicing conditions, we usually choose the dimension whose range
is smaller than the total value range after slicing, which often means that the
filtered amount of data is smaller.</span></span><span lang=EN
style='mso-ansi-language:EN'></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='color:black;
mso-ansi-language:EN'>The cgroups() function implements this selection. If there
are multiple pre-aggregated data sorted by different dimensions and there are multiple
slicing conditions, the most appropriate pre-aggregated data will be selected. When
cuboid() creates the pre-aggregated data, the order of grouped dimensions is meaningful
as different pre-aggregated data will be created for different dimension
orders.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='color:black;
mso-ansi-language:EN'>It is also possible to manually select a properly sorted
data set with code, and store more sorted data sets.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=jlqj4b><span lang=EN style='color:black;
mso-ansi-language:EN'>The redundant sorting method is not only appropriate for
multidimensional analysis, but also for the conventional traversal with filter
condition. The reason for taking multidimensional analysis as an example is
that the relevant features of this method will be more obvious while slicing
the dimensions in multi-dimensional analysis, and it is more suitable to
explain.</span></span></p>
